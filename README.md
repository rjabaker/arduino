## Build Instructions

<b> RBaker: November 18, 2012 </b>

To run the arduino code, you'll need to be connected to the Arduino board via USB. Open the Arduino environment (Arduino 1.0.2, which can be downloaded from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Open the skynet.ino file. Go to Tools > Serial Port and select the port which the board is connected to. (For the purposes of testing, connect it to COM5, since that's where the kinect code assumes it is). Compile the code and then upload it to the board.
